I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree at the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China. I am in the [Visual Analytics and Intelligence Group](https://zjuvag.org/) and under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/index_cn.html). My research topic is heterogeneous data mining and visual analytics in healthcare, specifically involving **visual analytics**, **causal analysis**, **out-of-distribution detection**, and **privacy preservation**.

I earned my B.S degree in computer science and technology from Central South University in 2019. As an undergraduate student, I have conducted research under the supervision of Prof. [Jiazhi Xia](https://www.xiajiazhi.com/index.html), where I focused on high-dimensional data visualization.

I am looking for a job in big data analytics with a focus on the following areas: data visualization and trustworthy artificial intelligence, such as explainable AI and causal inference.
