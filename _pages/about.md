I graduated with my Ph.D. in 2024 from the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China. I am in the [Visual Analytics and Intelligence Group](https://zjuvag.org/) and under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/index_cn.html). My research topic is visual analytics approaches for multi-source heterogeneous time-series data, specifically involving **visual analytics**, **out-of-distribution detection**, **causal analysis**, **explainable AI** and **privacy preservation**.

I earned my B.S. degree in computer science and technology from Central South University in 2019. As an undergraduate student, I have conducted research under the supervision of Prof. [Jiazhi Xia](https://www.xiajiazhi.com/index.html), where I focused on high-dimensional data visualization.

I am currently an algorithm engineer in the Alimama department of Alibaba Taotian Group. I am interested in data analysis, visualization, risk control, and large model applications in the advertising field.
