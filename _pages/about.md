I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree in Human-Computer Interaction at the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/index_cn.html). My research interests include **visual analytics**, **causal analysis**, **out-of-distribution detection**, and **privacy preservation**, with a special interest in their applications in healthcare.
